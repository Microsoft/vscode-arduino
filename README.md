# Arduino for Visual Studio Code

Welcome to **Arduino** for Visual Studio Code! The Arduino extension makes it easy to code, build and deploy your Arduino sketches in Visual Studio Code.

* Verify and upload your Arduino sketches in Visual Studio Code.
* Built-in Arduino board and library manager.
* Built-in Arduino example list.
* Built-in serial port monitoring tool.
* IntelliSense support and syntax highlighting based on C++ for VSCode.
* Snippets for \*.ino files.
* Automatic Arduino project initialization for \*.ino file.
* Commond Palette(F1) integration for most common Arduino commands (e.g. Verify, Upload...).

## Prerequisites

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). Please choose stable version for your operating system.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)
- [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools). Follow the steps to install or update to version 0.10.5 or later.

## Using
Open VS Code and press `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open command palette, select **Install Extension** and type `vscode-arduino`.

Or launch VS Code Quick Open (`Ctrl + P`), paste the following command, and press enter.
```bash
ext install vscode-arduino
```

## Commands
This extension provides several commands in the Command Palette (**F1** or **Ctrl+Shift+P**) for working with `*.ino` files:

- **Arduino: Boards Manager**: Manage development platforms for additional boards. You can add 3rd party Arduino board / Additional Board Manager URLs in Boards Manager.
- **Arduino: Change Baud Rate**: Change the band rate of current serial port communication.
- **Arduino: Change Board Type**: Show the list of installed board. Switch your board type or platform.
- **Arduino: Close Serial Monitor**: Stop serial monitoring tool and release the occupied serial port.
- **Arduino: Examples**: Show example list.
- **Arduino: Initialize**ï¼šInitialize your Arduino project.
- **Arduino: Libraries Manage**: Show a list of libraries that are already installed or ready for installation.
- **Arduino: Open Serial Monitor**: Open serial monotoring tool in the intergrated output window.
- **Arduino: Select Serial Port**: List all avaliable serial ports. Switch the serial port you want to use. 
- **Arduino: Send Text to Serial Port**: Send a line of text via the specified serial port.
- **Arduino: Upload**: Build your sketch file and deploy (upload) to your Arduino board via serial port.
- **Arduino: Verify**: Build (verify) your sketch files.

## Options
The following Visual Studio Code settings are available for the Arduino extension. These can be set in user preferences `Ctrl + ,` or workspace settings (.vscode/settings.json)

```json
{
    "arduino.path": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Arduino",
    "arduino.additionalUrls": "",
    "arduino.autoUpdateIndexFiles": false,
    "arduino.logLevel": "info"
}
```
- `arduino.path` - Path to Arduino, you can use a custom version of Arduino by modifying this setting to include the full path. Example: `C:\\Program Files\\Arduino` for Windows, `/Applications` for Mac, `/home/$user/Downloads/arduino-1.8.1` for Linux. (Requires a restart after change). The default value is automatically detected from your Arduino IDE installation path.
- `arduino.additionalUrls` - Additional URLs for 3-rd party packages. You can have multiple URLs in one string with comma(,) as separator, or have a string array. The default value is empty.
- `arduino.autoUpdateIndexFiles` - Controls auto update of package_index.json and library_index.json index files. If enabled, each time when you open Boards Manager/Libraries Manager, download latest index files first. Otherwise, using index files cached on local disk for Boards Manager/Libraries Manager. The default value is `false`
- `arduino.logLevel` - CLI output log level. Could be info or verbose. The default value is `"info"`.

## Supported Operating Systems
Currently this extension supports the following operatings systems:

- Windows 7 and later (32-bit and 64-bit)
- macOS 10.10 and later
