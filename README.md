Welcome to **Arduino** <sup>preview</sup> for Visual Studio Code! The Arduino extension makes it easy to code, build, deploy and debug your Arduino sketches in Visual Studio Code.

* IntelliSense and syntax highlighting for Arduino sketches
* Verify and upload your sketches in Visual Studio Code
* Built-in board and library manager
* Built-in example list
* Built-in serial monitor
* Snippets for sketches
* Automatic Arduino project scaffolding
* Command Palette (F1) integration of frequently used commands (e.g. Verify, Upload...)
* Integrated Arduino Debugging <sup>New</sup> 

## Prerequisites
Arduino IDE is required. Please install it from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software#download).
- The supported Arduino IDE versions are 1.6.x and later.
- The Windows Store's version of Arduino IDE is not supported because of the sandbox environment of Windows app.

## Installation
Open VS Code and press `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open command palette, select **Install Extension** and type `vscode-arduino`.

Or launch VS Code Quick Open (`Ctrl + P`), paste the following command, and press enter.
```bash
ext install vscode-arduino
```

## Commands
This extension provides several commands in the Command Palette (**F1** or **Ctrl+Shift+P**) for working with `*.ino` files:

- **Arduino: Board Manager**: Manage packages for boards. You can add 3rd party Arduino board by configuring `Additional Board Manager URLs` in board manager.
- **Arduino: Change Baud Rate**: Change the baud rate of selected serial port.
- **Arduino: Change Board Type**: Change board type or platform.
- **Arduino: Close Serial Monitor**: Stop serial monitor and release the serial port.
- **Arduino: Examples**: Show example list.
- **Arduino: Initialize**ï¼šScaffold a VS Code project with an Arduino sketch.
- **Arduino: Library Manager**: Explore and manage libraries.
- **Arduino: Open Serial Monitor**: Open serial monitor in the intergrated output window.
- **Arduino: Select Serial Port**: Change the current serial port.
- **Arduino: Send Text to Serial Port**: Send a line of text via the current serial port.
- **Arduino: Upload**: Build sketch and upload to Arduino board.
- **Arduino: Verify**: Build sketch.

## Options
The following Visual Studio Code settings are available for the Arduino extension. These can user preferences `Ctrl + ,` or workspace settings (.vscode/settings.json). The later overrides the former.

```json
{
    "arduino.path": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Arduino",
    "arduino.additionalUrls": "",
    "arduino.autoUpdateIndexFiles": false,
    "arduino.logLevel": "info"
}
```
- `arduino.path` - Path to Arduino, you can use a custom version of Arduino by modifying this setting to include the full path. Example: `C:\\Program Files\\Arduino` for Windows, `/Applications` for Mac, `/home/$user/Downloads/arduino-1.8.1` for Linux. (Requires a restart after change). The default value is automatically detected from your Arduino IDE installation path.
- `arduino.additionalUrls` - Additional URLs for 3rd party packages. You can have multiple URLs in one string with comma(,) as separator, or have a string array. The default value is empty.
- `arduino.autoUpdateIndexFiles` - Controls auto update of package_index.json and library_index.json index files. If enabled, each time when you open Boards Manager/Libraries Manager, download latest index files first. Otherwise, using index files cached on local disk for Boards Manager/Libraries Manager. The default value is `false`.
- `arduino.logLevel` - CLI output log level. Could be info or verbose. The default value is `"info"`.

## Debugging Arduino Code <sup>preview</sup>
Before you start debug your Arduino code, read [this doc](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) and get to know the basic mechanism about debugging in Visual Studio Code. Also see [debugging for C++ in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_debugging) for your reference.

Make sure your Arduino board can work with [STLink](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html), [Jlink](https://www.segger.com/jlink-debug-probes.html) or [EDBG](http://www.atmel.com/webdoc/protocoldocs/ch01s01.html). The debugging support currently is fully tested with the following boards.
- [MXChip IoT Developer Kit - AZ3166](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/)
- [Arduino M0 PRO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardM0PRO)
- [Adafruit WICED WiFi Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3056)
- [Adafruit Feather M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3010)
- Arduino Zero Pro

Steps to start debugging:
1. Plugin your board to your development machine properly. For those boards don't have on-board debugging chip, you need use STLink or JLink connector.
2. Go to **Debug View** (Ctrl+Shift+D). Set breakpoints in your source files.
3. Press **F5** to select debugging environment. 
4. When your breakpoint is hit, you can see variables and add expression to watch on the Debug Side Bar.

## Supported Operating Systems
Currently this extension supports the following operatings systems:

- Windows 7 and later (32-bit and 64-bit)
- macOS 10.10 and later
- Ubuntu 16.04
  - The extension might work on other Linux distro as some user reported but without gurantee.
